## Tech Stack

- Next.js using my [boilerplate](https://github.com/novellito/the-nextjs-starter)
- Serverless (JS Lambdas)


## Motive 

I mainly created this project to keep my React skills sharp as much of my work revolves around using Angular. This project also gave me more experience in working with serverless technologies which is all the rage right now. Along the way, I learned about Reddits API & about other libraries such as [react-infinite-scroll-component](https://www.npmjs.com/package/react-infinite-scroll-component), [styled-components](https://styled-components.com/) and of course [react-redux](https://react-redux.js.org/).
