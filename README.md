If you somehow stumbled across this repo during Hacktoberfest and would like to contribute, here are some things that I'm looking for contributions on:

- [ ] Infinite Scroll - using an existing popular library such as [react-infinite-scroller](https://www.npmjs.com/package/react-infinite-scroller)
- [ ] Adding a simple dark theme to the app
